1)Rewrite huffmanCode class so that it is compatible with Multipart file
    Suggestion: make compress and decompress methods return multipart files instead of void. Maybe rewrite "write" methods
    so that they don't create files but rather inputStreams.
//Done
2)Service classes
//Done
3)Api layering/controllers
//Done
4)Frontend
    Suggestion: ThymeLeaf?

Thoughts:
Keeping file data in h2 db seems like a good idea. Later can be rewritten to other databases to learn Docker, maybe?

Deadline: October, 10
